In this 3D perception project, PR2 robot needs to identify the items on the table in front. There are total of 8 items which are sticky notes, book, snacks, biscuits, eraser, soap2, soap and glue. PR2 with its RGBD camera percieves these items. Gazebo and RViz is used in ROS environment to simulate the perception and pick & place operations.

The project repository can be found on [here.](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project)
Steps to perform and additional information is available in the repository.

For my implementation please check the [write-up](https://github.com/bahadirozkan/Perception_PR2/blob/master/Write-up.pdf) document.
